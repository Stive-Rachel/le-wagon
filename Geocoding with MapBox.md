Mapbox is a service used by large companies to obtain geographical information (maps, localisation, points of interests‚Ä¶).

We will use their API to find coordinates.


### 1- Go to üîó https://www.mapbox.com/ and find the API documentation.
+ https://docs.mapbox.com/playground/

### 2- From there, find the geocoding API documentation.
+ https://docs.mapbox.com/playground/geocoding/

### 3- What are the use cases for geocoding?
+ The Mapbox Geocoding API allows you to search for addresses and places by name (forward search) or coordinates (reverse search).

### 4- Create a Mapbox account and get your access token.
Use a signup button and fill in the form.
Verify your email address by following the instructions.

üöß If you can, don‚Äôt use a gmail address as it will ask for your credit card info otherwise. After you finish, you will be given an access token to make API queries.

If you nonetheless continue to experience issues, you can use üîó https://developers.google.com/maps as an alternative.
+ Done!
